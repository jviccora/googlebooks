# Google Books Search

## Description
To create a React-based Google Books Search application. This project required me to create React components, work with util functions, and utilize React lifestyle methods to query and display based on user searches. This app uses React, Google Books API, Node, Express, and MongoDB. Users can save books to review or purchase later.

None is required.

## Usage

Steps:

1. Go to Google Books Search site
2. Search for a Book - click SEARCH after you enter book name/title.
3. Once SEARCH is clicked the results will show.
4. Results showing will give you the option to 'View' book on Google Play or 'Save' book for later reviewing.
5. If you click 'Save' you can view your saved list by selecting SAVED tab at the top right hand corner.
6. Once in the Saved tab you can 'View' book for reading a sample of it or your can 'Delete' book once no longer interested.
